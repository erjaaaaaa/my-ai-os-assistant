# Lessons learned — hot file

Read at the start of every run of every routine; every rule here is applied.
Append one entry per correction. Never reword or delete an entry — if a rule
changes, append a new one saying which it replaces. Entries older than 7 days
are candidates for the promotion review (see `AGENTS.md` § The learning loop).

- 2026-09-07 — **The personal mailbox has a manual label tree** — The setup
  interview recorded "no manual labels", but the control query returned a
  46-label user tree (`Action Required/…`, `Finance & Accounts/…`, and more).
  **Rule:** treat every Gmail user label as Eriks's own; read them as signal,
  never write, remove or rename one, and re-check the label list at Step 0
  rather than trusting an interview answer about it.
- 2026-09-07 — **Todoist labels are shared with another instance on the same
  account** — `someday`, `agent-waiting` and `size/*` already existed.
  **Rule:** every task search that filters by label is scoped to project
  Personal by id, never run account-wide.
